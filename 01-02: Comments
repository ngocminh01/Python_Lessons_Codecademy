Comments can:
1/ Provide context for why something is written the way it is:
# This variable will be used to count the number of times anyone tweets the word persnickety
persnickety_count = 0

2/ Help other people reading the code understand it faster:
# This code will calculate the likelihood that it will rain tomorrow
complicated_rain_calculation_for_tomorrow()

3/ Ignore a line of code and see how a program will run without it:
# useful_value = old_sloppy_code()
useful_value = new_clean_code()
