# Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError and NameError.

# SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written â€” punctuation that does not belong, 
a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.

# A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that 
looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.
