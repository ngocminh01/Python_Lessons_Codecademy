Suppose we want to make a list of the heights of students in a class:

Noelle is 61 inches tall
Ava is 70 inches tall
Sam is 67 inches tall
Mia is 64 inches tall

In Python, we can create a variable called heights to store these integers into a list:

heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]

A list begins and ends with square brackets ([ and ]).
Each item (i.e., 67 or 70) is separated by a comma (,)
It’s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma, but your code will run just fine if you forget the space.

1. Examine the existing list heights in your code editor.

A new student just joined the class!
Chloe is 65 inches tall
Add Chloe’s height to the end of the list heights.

heights = [61, 70, 67, 64, 65]

2. Remove the # in front of the definition of the list broken_heights. If you run this code, you’ll get an error in your terminal:

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Add commas (,) to broken_heights so that it runs without errors.

broken_heights = [65, 71, 59, 62]
