Instead of storing each student’s height, we can make a list that contains their names:
names = ["Noelle", "Ava", "Sam", "Mia"]

We can even combine multiple data types in one list. For example, this list contains both a string and an integer:
mixed_list_string_number = ["Noelle", 61]

Lists can contain any data type in Python! For example, this list contains a string, integer, boolean, and float.
mixed_list_common = ["Mia", 27, False, 0.5]

1. Add any additional string to the end of the list ints_and_strings.
ints_and_strings = [1, 2, 3, "four", "five", "six"]

2. Create a new list called sam_height_and_testscore that contains:
The string "Sam" (to represent Sam’s name)
The number 67 (to represent Sam’s height)
The float 85.5 (to represent Sam’s score)
The boolean True (to represent Sam passing the test)
Make sure to write the elements in exact order.

sam_height_and_testscore = ["Sam", 67, 85.5, True]
