We can add a single element to a list using the .append() Python method.

Suppose we have an empty list called garden:
garden = []

We can add the element "Tomatoes" by using the .append() method:
garden.append("Tomatoes")
print(garden)

Will output:
['Tomatoes']

When we use .append() on a list that already has elements, our new element is added to the end of the list:

# Create a list
garden = ["Tomatoes", "Grapes", "Cauliflower"]
 
# Append a new element
garden.append("Green Beans")
print(garden)

Will output:
['Tomatoes', 'Grapes', 'Cauliflower', 'Green Beans']

1. Jiho works for a gardening store called Petal Power. 
Jiho keeps a record of orders in a list called orders.
Use print to inspect the orders he has received today.
2. Jiho just received a new order for "tulips". Use append to add this string to orders.
3. Another order has come in! Use append to add "roses" to orders.
4. Use print to inspect the orders Jiho has received today.

orders = ["daisies", "periwinkle"]
print(orders)
orders.append("tulips")
orders.append("roses")
print(orders)
