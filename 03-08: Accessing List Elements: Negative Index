Consider the following list with 6 elements:
pancake_recipe = ["eggs", "flour", "butter", "milk", "sugar", "love"]

If we select the -1 index, we get the final element, "love".
print(pancake_recipe[-1])
Would output:
love

This is equivalent to selecting the element with index 5:
print(pancake_recipe[5])
Would output:
love

Here are the negative index numbers for our list:

Element	Index
"eggs"	-6
"flour"	-5
"butter"	-4
"milk"	-3
"sugar"	-2
"love"	-1

1. Create a variable called last_element.
Assign the last element in shopping_list to the variable last_element using a negative index.
2. Now select the element with index 5 and save it to the variable index5_element.
3. Use print to display both index5_element and last_element.
Note that they are equal to "cereal"!

shopping_list = ["eggs", "butter", "milk", "cucumbers", "juice", "cereal"]
last_element = shopping_list[-1]
index5_element = shopping_list[5]
print(last_element)
print(index5_element)
