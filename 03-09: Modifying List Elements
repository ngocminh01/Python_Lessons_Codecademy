garden = ["Tomatoes", "Green Beans", "Cauliflower", "Grapes"]

We will need to modify the list to accommodate the change to our garden list. 
To change a value in a list, reassign the value using the specific index.
garden[2] = "Strawberries"
print(garden)

Will output:
["Tomatoes", "Green Beans", "Strawberries", "Grapes"]

Negative indices will work as well.
garden[-1] = "Raspberries"
print(garden)

Will output:
["Tomatoes", "Green Beans", "Strawberries", "Raspberries"]

1. We decided to create a waitlist to make sure we can sell to all of our new customers!
Define a list called garden_waitlist and set the value to contain our customers (in order): "Jiho", "Adam", "Sonny", and "Alisha".
2. "Adam" decided his fridge is too full at the moment and asked us to remove him from the waitlist and make space for one of our other townsfolk.
Replace "Adam" with our other interested customer "Calla" using the index method we used in the narrative.
Print garden_waitlist to see the change!
3. Alisha realized she was already stocked with all the items we are selling. 
She asked us to replace her with her friend Alex who just ran out.
Replace Alisha with Alex using a negative index.
Print garden_waitlist again to see the change!

# Your code below:
garden_waitlist = ["Jiho", "Adam", "Sonny", "Alisha"]
garden_waitlist[1] = "Calla"
print(garden_waitlist)
garden_waitlist[-1] = "Alex"
print(garden_waitlist)
