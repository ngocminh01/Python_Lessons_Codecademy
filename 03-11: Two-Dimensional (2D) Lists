1. A new student named "Vik" has joined our class. Vik is 68 inches tall. 
Add a sublist to the end of the heights list that represents Vik and his height.
2. Create a two-dimensional list called ages where each sublist contains a studentâ€™s name and their age. 
Use the following data:
"Aaron" is 15
"Dhruti" is 16

heights = [["Jenny", 61], ["Alexus", 70], ["Sam", 67], ["Grace", 64], ["Vik", 68]]
ages = [["Aaron", 15], ["Dhruti", 16]]
