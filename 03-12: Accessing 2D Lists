heights = [["Noelle", 61], ["Ali", 70], ["Sam", 67]]

#Access the sublist at index 0, and then access the 1st index of that sublist. 
noelles_height = heights[0][1] 
print(noelles_height)

Would output:
61

Here are the index numbers to access data for the list heights:

Element	Index
"Noelle"	heights[0][0]
61	heights[0][1]
"Ali"	heights[1][0]
70	heights[1][1]
"Sam"	heights[2][0]
67	heights[2][1]

1. We want to have a way to store all of our classroom test score data.
Using the provided table, create a two-dimensional list called class_name_test to represent the data. 
Each sublist in class_name_test should have one student’s name and their associated score.
Name	Test Score
"Jenny"	90
"Alexus"	85.5
"Sam"	83
"Ellie"	101.5
Print class_name_test to see the result.
2. Use double square brackets ([][]) to select Sam‘s test score from the list class_name_test.
Save it to the variable sams_score.
Print the variable sams_score to see the result.
3. Use double square brackets ([][]) to select Ellies test score from the list class_name_test. This time only use negative indices!
Save it to the variable ellies_score.
Print the variable ellies_score to see the result.

#Your code below:
class_name_test = [["Jenny", 90], ["Alexus", 85.5], ["Sam", 83], ["Ellie", 101.5]]
print(class_name_test)
sams_score = class_name_test[2][1]
print(sams_score)
ellies_score = class_name_test[-1][-1]
print(ellies_score)
