class_name_hobbies = [["Jenny", "Breakdancing"], ["Alexus", "Photography"], ["Grace", "Soccer"]]

# The list of Jenny is at index 0. The hobby is at index 1. 
class_name_hobbies[0][1] = "Meditation"
print(class_name_hobbies)

Would output:
[["Jenny", "Meditation"], ["Alexus", "Photography"], ["Grace", "Soccer"]]

Negative indices will work as well.
# The list of Grace is the last entry. The hobby is the last element. 
class_name_hobbies[-1][-1] = "Football"
print(class_name_hobbies)

Would output:
[["Jenny", "Meditation"], ["Alexus", "Photography"], ["Grace", "Football"]]

1. Our school is expanding! We are welcoming a new set of students today from all over the world.
Using the provided table, create a two-dimensional list called incoming_class to represent the data. 
Each sublist in incoming_class should contain the name, nationality, and grade for a single student.
Name	Nationality	Grade Level
"Kenny"	"American"	9
"Tanya"	"Ukrainian"	9
"Madison"	"Indian"	7
Print incoming_class to see our list.

2. "Madison" passed an exam to advance a grade. She will be pushed into 8th grade rather than her current 7th in our list.
Modify the list using double brackets [][] to make the change. Use positive indices.
Print incoming_class to see our change.

3. "Kenny" likes to be called by his nickname "Ken". 
Modify the list using double brackets [][] to accommodate the change but only using negative indices.
Print incoming_class to see our change.

#Your code below:
incoming_class = [["Kenny", "American", 9], ["Tanya","Ukrainian", 9], ["Madison", "Indian", 7]]
print(incoming_class)
incoming_class[2][2] = 8
print(incoming_class)
incoming_class[-3][-3] = "Ken"
print(incoming_class)
