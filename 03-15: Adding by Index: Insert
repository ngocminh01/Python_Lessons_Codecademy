1. We are helping out a popular grocery store called Jihoâ€™s Produce.
Every week the store has to choose the order in which it displays some of its popular items on sale in the front window to attract customers.
Jiho, the store owner, likes to store the items for the display in a list.
Check out the current display list in our code editor. Click Run to print out the list.

2. Jiho found out some great news! "Pineapple" is back in stock.
Jiho would like to put "Pineapple" in the front of the list so it is the first item customers see in the display window.
Use .insert() to add "Pineapple" to the front of the list.
Print the resulting list to see the change.
Note: For this list, the front will be the element at index 0


front_display_list = ["Mango", "Filet Mignon", "Chocolate Milk"]
print(front_display_list)

# Your code below: 
front_display_list.insert(0, "Pineapple")
print(front_display_list)
