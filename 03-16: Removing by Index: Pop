cs_topics = ["Python", "Data Structures", "Balloon Making", "Algorithms", "Clowns 101"]
removed_element = cs_topics.pop()
print(cs_topics)
print(removed_element)

Would output:
['Python', 'Data Structures', 'Balloon Making', 'Algorithms']
'Clowns 101'

cs_topics.pop(2)
print(cs_topics)

Would output:
['Python', 'Data Structures', 'Algorithms']

1. We have decided to pursue the study of data science in addition to our computer science coursework. 
We signed up for an online school that would help us become proficient.
Check out the current list of topics we will be studying in our code editor.
Click Run to print out the list.
2. It looks like we have an overlap with our computer science curriculum for the topic of "Python 3".
Let’s remove the topic from the list of data_science_topics using our newly learned .pop() method.
Print data_science_topics to see your result.
3. Looks like there is overlap on the "Algorithms" topic as well. Let’s use .pop() to remove it as well.
Print data_science_topics to see the changes.

data_science_topics = ["Machine Learning", "SQL", "Pandas", "Algorithms", "Statistics", "Python 3"]
print(data_science_topics)

# Your code below: 
data_science_topics.pop()
print(data_science_topics)

data_science_topics.pop(3)
print(data_science_topics)
