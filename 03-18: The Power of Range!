If we call range() with two inputs, we can create a list that starts at a different number.
For example, range(2, 9) would generate numbers starting at 2 and ending at 8 (just before 9):

my_list = range(2, 9)
print(list(my_list))

Would output:
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]


If we use a third input, we can create a list that “skips” numbers.
For example, range(2, 9, 2) will give us a list where each number is 2 greater than the previous number:

my_range2 = range(2, 9, 2)
print(list(my_range2

Would output:
[2, 4, 6, 8]


We can skip as many numbers as we want!
For example, we’ll start at 1 and skip in increments of 10 between each number until we get to 99 (one before 100):

my_range3 = range(1, 100, 10)
print(list(my_range3))

Would output:
[1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91]

1. Modify the range() function that created the range range_five_three such that it:
Starts at 5
Has a difference of 3 between each item
Ends before 15

2. Create a range called range_diff_five that:
Starts at 0
Has a difference of 5 between each item
Ends before 40

# Your code below: 
range_five_three = range(5, 15, 3)
range_diff_five = range(0, 40, 5)
