When we apply len() to a list, we get the number of elements in that list:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(my_list))

Would output:
5

1. Calculate the length of long_list and save it to the variable long_list_len.
2. Use print() to examine long_list_len.
3. We have provided a completed range() function for the variable big_range.
Calculate its length using the function len() and save it to a variable called big_range_length.
Note: Range objects do not need to be converted to lists in order to determine their length
4. Use print() to examine big_range_length.
5. Change the range() function that generates big_range so that it skips 100 instead of 10 steps between items.
How does this change big_range_length?

long_list = [1, 5, 6, 7, -23, 69.5, True, "very", "long", "list", "that", "keeps", "going.", "Let's", "practice", "getting", "the", "length"]

big_range = range(2, 3000, 100)

# Your code below: 
long_list_len = len(long_list)
print(long_list_len)

big_range_length = len(big_range)
print(big_range_length)
