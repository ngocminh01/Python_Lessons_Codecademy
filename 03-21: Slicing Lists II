Take the list fruits as our example:
fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "pineapple", "orange", "mango"]

For our fruits list, suppose we wanted to slice the first three elements.
print(fruits[:3])
Would output:
['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple']

For our fruits list, suppose we wanted to slice the last two elements.
print(fruits[-2:])
Would output:
['orange', 'mango']

For our fruits example, suppose we wanted to slice all but the last element from the list.
print(fruits[:-1])
Would output:
['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'orange']

1. Create a new list called last_two_elements containing the final two elements of suitcase.
Print last_two_elements to see your result.

2. Create a new list called slice_off_last_three containing all but the last three elements.
Print slice_off_last_three to see your result.

suitcase = ["shirt", "shirt", "pants", "pants", "pajamas", "books"]

# Your code below: 
last_two_elements = suitcase[-2:]
print(last_two_elements)

slice_off_last_three = suitcase[:-3]
print(slice_off_last_three)
