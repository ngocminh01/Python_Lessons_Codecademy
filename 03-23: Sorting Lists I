names = ["Xander", "Buffy", "Angel", "Willow", "Giles"]
names.sort()
print(names)

Would output:
['Angel', 'Buffy', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'Xander']


names.sort(reverse=True)
print(names)

Would output:
['Xander', 'Willow', 'Giles', 'Buffy', 'Angel']

1. Use .sort() to sort addresses.
2. Use print() to see how addresses changed.
3. Remove the # and whitespace in front of the line sort(names). Edit this line so that it runs without producing a NameError.
4. Use print to examine sorted_cities. Why is it not the sorted version of cities?
# The .sort() method does not return any value and thus does not need to be assigned to a variable. 
# This is why we will see the value of None as our output for sorted_cities
5. Edit the .sort() call on cities such that it sorts the cities in reverse order (descending).
Print cities to see the result.

# Checkpoint 1 & 2
addresses = ["221 B Baker St.", "42 Wallaby Way", "12 Grimmauld Place", "742 Evergreen Terrace", "1600 Pennsylvania Ave", "10 Downing St."]
addresses.sort()
print(addresses)
# Checkpoint 3
names = ["Ron", "Hermione", "Harry", "Albus", "Sirius"]
sorted_cities = names.sort()
print(sorted_cities)
# Checkpoint 4 & 5
cities = ["London", "Paris", "Rome", "Los Angeles", "New York"]
cities.sort(reverse=True)
print(cities)
