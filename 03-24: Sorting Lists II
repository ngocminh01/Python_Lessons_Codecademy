names = ["Xander", "Buffy", "Angel", "Willow", "Giles"]
sorted_names = sorted(names)
print(sorted_names)

This yields the list sorted alphabetically:
['Angel', 'Buffy', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'Xander']

Note that using sorted did not change names:
print(names)
Would output:
['Xander', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Willow', 'Giles']

#########################################

1. Use sorted() to order games and create a new list called games_sorted
2. Print both games and games_sorted. How are they different?
# In contrast to the method .sort(), the built-in function sorted() will not modify the original list.

games = ["Portal", "Minecraft", "Pacman", "Tetris", "The Sims", "Pokemon"]

# Your code below:
games_sorted = sorted(games)
print(games)
print(games_sorted)
